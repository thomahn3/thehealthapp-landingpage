# Landing page for a potential health centered app
This is the [landing page](https://thehealthapp.vercel.app/) to collect potentially interested people for a mobile app to incorpate all the different disciplines of health apps into a centered app with an AI incorporation to analyse different trends, such as your mood is generally happier when you eat more protien, read and excersie. This was my first website with next.js and I would say it was successful. It records the emials using a NotionAPI POST request to a database. 

Wireframe for an outline of the app (uncompleted):\

## Landing page for a potential health centered app
This is the [landing page](https://thehealthapp.vercel.app/) to collect potentially interested people for my mobile app to incorpate all the different disciplines of health apps into a centered app with an AI incorporation to analyse different trends, such as your mood is generally happier when you eat more protien, read and excersie.

## The Health App
Ever stopped to wonder why you have so many different apps for different functions that all contribute to your own health? I did and I realised multiple problems arise having different ‘sub-functions’ in each app. If I have an app for tracking my strength training, a different one for tracking my calorie intake and another one for tracking my habits and moods (yes mental health is heavily incorporated into your physical health), I can’t see the correlations, trends or similarities between each ‘sub-function’. Apple Health tries to achieve this by consolidating all of your data in one place and providing trends in each section but it is up to you to identify the statistics between these sections. This is a personal trainer in your pocket if they had access to you 24/7. 

I have no means to replace existing apps with complex functionalities but a means to properly consolidate and evaluate the data for you. For example, people have been using strava for over a decade, I would never have a means to replace their existing functionality as it has been updated for years. Despite this, I wish to have a means to import data from apps such as myfitnesspal, strong, apple health, etc. I aim to include the functionality of these apps into ‘The Health App’ to allow onboarding for people who haven’t used these apps before to have one place to record information to decrease the friction and help people achieve their goals. 

A bit about me and why I have set out to make this a reality. I personally have been on a fitness journey. I was fat in middle school and suffered multiple counts of remarks, looks, and exclusions from people in my cohort. I had 1 or 2 close friends and the rest made me feel like an outsider. I moved cities and it sparked a change in my life. In the span of 2 and a half years I went from getting home from school everyday, playing video games for 6 hours, eating junk food to carefully monitoring my eating, spending 2 hours in the gym most days, and sold my xbox. If I had done it before finishing school then I want to show others around me, older than me or strangers on the opposite side of the world it can be done too. 

This app aims to consolidate all of your data within one place and use AI (so overused I know) to identify trends between areas of your health, physical and mental, that could impact your progress and hinder achieving your goals. The aim is to create as little friction as possible for a person using ‘The Health App’. “The less friction you face, the easier it is for your stronger self to emerge. The idea behind making it easy is not to only do easy things. The idea is to make it as easy as possible in the moment to do things that payoff in the long run. - James Clear, Atomic Habits”. 

Time to give credit where it is due. [Macrofactor](https://twitter.com/macrofactorapp) was the main leading inspiration for this app. The real time updates to caloric intake to improve achieving your goals gave me a thought of what if this could apply to all areas of your health? Adjusting sets in the gym to improve muscle growth. Adjusting intensity of runs to maximise recovery for an event or sport match. With AI getting more powerful for what seems everyday the correlations and machine learning capabilities can only improve. The layout is similar to the app ‘Strong’ and I like the simplicity of the sections as eye-catching widgets. 


If you have read this far I greatly appreciate it and ask that you subscribe to hear any news about the development in the future at [The Health App](https://thehealthapp.vercel.app/). This is quite an ambitious project so I look forward to what this will bring in the future. Please comment below if you have any ideas, especially about fonts, feedback or considerations I have missed. I thank all of you who wish to support me and watch this idea become a reality.
